# Namer

Very simple name generator web app, seeded with fragments of actual planet and moon names.

See it here:

Some ideas for improvements:

- Change how names are seeded? Right now it's completely random
- Larger/smaller fragments?
- Find other name sources
- Make some smarter name decisions, like not putting consonants one after the other
